abstract = {Internal market structure analysis infers brand positions in an$\backslash$nattribute space from preference and choice data, given a market in which$\backslash$nconsumers have heterogeneous tastes for attributes. Previous market$\backslash$nstructure models have adopted a static framework (e.g., Elrod 1988,$\backslash$nChintagunta 1994, Elrod and Keane 1995). Furthermore, they assumed that$\backslash$nconsumer perceptions of brand attributes do not vary across consumers.$\backslash$nYet, these approaches may render inaccurate representations of market$\backslash$nstructure if there is state dependence in consumer choice behavior. This$\backslash$npaper attempts to incorporate consumer choice dynamics into market$\backslash$nstructure models by specifying the source of choice dynamics explicitly.$\backslash$nIn particular, the process by which past purchases affect current$\backslash$nchoices is modeled in a framework which captures both consumer habit$\backslash$npersistence and variety seeking behavior. More specifically, consumer$\backslash$npreferences for brand attributes are modeled to depend on the attributes$\backslash$nof brands bought on the previous purchase occasion. Furthermore, the$\backslash$nmodeling approach adopted incorporates heterogeneity in both consumer$\backslash$npreferences and perceptions of brand attributes. The audience of this$\backslash$npaper includes practitioners and academics interested in understanding$\backslash$nconsumer choice processes and inferring market structure from consumer$\backslash$nchoice data.$\backslash$nThe proposed models are estimated on Nielsen scanner panel data for$\backslash$nmargarine, peanut butter, yogurt, and liquid detergent using simulated$\backslash$nmaximum likelihood techniques. The empirical results suggest that$\backslash$naccounting for choice dynamics improves both in-sample and out-of-sample$\backslash$nfit. The results indicate that the average consumer is habit persistent$\backslash$nin all the product categories studied. This result is consistent with$\backslash$nthe findings of Kannan and Sanchez (1994), who conducted an aggregate$\backslash$nanalysis of consumer variety seeking behavior across product categories.$\backslash$nHowever, the results obtained in this paper suggest that consumers are$\backslash$nheterogeneous with respect to the processes by which past purchases$\backslash$naffect current purchases.$\backslash$nThese results provide strong evidence for habit persistence and variety$\backslash$nseeking in brand attributes to be the behavioral source of consumer$\backslash$nchoice dynamics in food categories. Thus, consumer tastes (utility$\backslash$nweights) seem to be affected by the attributes of the brands consumed in$\backslash$nthe past. Given the empirical result that a large proportion of$\backslash$nconsumers are habit persistent, this suggests that tastes are reinforced$\backslash$nby the brand attributes consumed in the past.$\backslash$nThe empirical results also show that not accounting for state dependence$\backslash$nin market structure models for panel data may produce misleading$\backslash$nresults, that is, depending on consumer behavior patterns, models that$\backslash$ndo not account for state dependence may distort the true nature of$\backslash$ncompetition among brands. More specifically, the results confirm the$\backslash$nexpectation that if there is habit persistence, that is, if consumer$\backslash$ntastes are reinforced by attributes of brands consumed in the past,$\backslash$nmodels that do not capture this choice dynamics will overestimate the$\backslash$ndistance between (similar) brands.$\backslash$nFurthermore, the policy experiments conducted suggest that (1) static$\backslash$nmodels overestimate the short-run impact of a price cut on the sales of$\backslash$nthe brand on promotion, (2) price cuts hurt the sales of the more$\backslash$nsimilar brands more, and (3) free samples affect relatively less similar$\backslash$nbrands the most.$\backslash$nFinally, this paper studies variety seeking and habit persistence across$\backslash$nbrands over purchase occasions. However, variety seeking behavior may$\backslash$nalso involve the purchase of a portfolio of brands or items at a$\backslash$npurchase occasion. Consumers may buy multiple items knowing that prior$\backslash$nto the next trip they may want to consume different items (Simanson$\backslash$n1990, Walsh 1995). This type of behavior can be modeled within the$\backslash$ncontext of dynamic expected utility maximization with forward-looking$\backslash$nconsumers. The development and estimation of market structure models$\backslash$nthat include forward-looking consumers who maximize expected-utility$\backslash$nover a planning horizon, incorporating their future tastes and needs,$\backslash$nand shopping for an inventory of brands, remain an important future$\backslash$nresearch issue.},

Based on an extensive Monte Carlo study, we show that the use of Chamberlain's (1987) optimal instruments overcomes many problems that have recently been documented with standard, non-optimal instruments. Optimal instruments reduce small sample bias, but they prove even more powerful in increasing the estimator's efficiency and stability. We consider a wide variety of data-generating processes and an empirical application to the automobile market. We also consider the gains of other recent methodological advances when combined with optimal instruments.},

@article{Gillingham2014b,
abstract = {Despite several decades of government policies to promote energy efficiency, estimates of the costs and benefits of such policies remain controversial. At the heart of the controversy is whether there is an “energy efficiency gap,” whereby consumers and firms fail to make seemingly positive net present value energy saving investments. High implicit discount rates, undervaluation of future fuel savings, and negative cost energy efficiency measures have all been discussed as evidence of the existence of a gap. We review explanations for an energy efficiency gap including reasons why the size of the gap may be overstated, neoclassical explanations for a gap, and recent evidence from behavioral economics that has potential to help us understand why a gap could exist. Our review raises fundamental questions about traditional welfare analysis, but we find the alternatives offered in the literature to be far from ready for use in policy analysis. Nevertheless, we offer several suggestions for policymakers and for future economic research. (JEL: Q38, Q41)},

abstract = {This article discusses automobile fuel economy standards in the United States and other countries. We first describe how these programs affect the automobile market, including impacts on fuel consumption and other dimensions of the vehicle fleet. We then review two different methodologies for assessing the costs of fuel economy programs-engineering and market-based approaches-and discuss what the results of these assessments imply for policy. Next we compare the welfare effects of fuel economy standards and fuel taxes and discuss whether these two types of policies can be complementary. Finally, we review arguments for transitioning away from fuel economy regulations and toward a "feebate" system, a policy approach that imposes fees on vehicles that are fuel inefficient and provides rebates to those that are fuel efficient.},

abstract = {US fuel economy standards have not been changed significantly in 20 years. Feebates are a market-based alternative in which vehicles with fuel consumption rates above a "pivot point" are charged fees while vehicles below receive rebates. By choice of pivot points, feebate systems can be made revenue neutral. Feebates have been analyzed before. This study re-examines feebates using recent data, assesses how the undervaluing of fuel economy by consumers might affect their efficacy, tests sensitivity to the cost of fuel economy technology and price elasticities of vehicle demand, and adds assessments of gas-guzzler taxes or rebates alone. A feebate rate of {\$}500 per 0.01 gallon per mile (GPM) produces a 16 percent increase in fuel economy, while a {\$}1000 per 0.01 GPM results in a 29 percent increase, even if consumers count only the first 3 years of fuel savings. Unit sales decline by about 0.5 percent but sales revenues increase because the added value of fuel economy technologies outweighs the decrease in sales. In all cases, the vast majority of fuel economy increase is due to adoption of fuel economy technologies rather than shifts in sales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we examine the effects of changing tax regimes in a differentiated product oligopoly. In order to illustrate our approach, we employ data from one such market: the automobile market in Israel.},

abstract = {We use data on the enrollment decisions of federal annuitants to estimate the influence of publicized ratings on health plan choice. We focus on the impact of ratings disseminated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and use our estimates to calculate the value of the information. Our approach exploits a novel feature of the data - the availability of nonpublic plan ratings - to correct for a source of bias that is inherent in studies of consumer responsiveness to information on product quality: since publicized ratings are correlated with other quality signals known to consumers (but unobserved by researchers), the estimated influence of ratings is likely to be overstated. We control for this bias by comparing the estimated impact of publicized ratings to the estimated impact of ratings that were never disclosed. The results indicate that NCQA's plan ratings had a meaningful influence on individuals' choices, particularly for individuals choosing a plan for the first time. Although we estimate that a very small fraction of individual decisions were materially affected by the information, for those that were affected the implied utility gains are substantial. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {If time and effort are required to accurately ascertain the lifetime value of energy efficiency for a durable good, consumers might rationally ignore energy efficiency. This paper argues that such inattention may be rational in the market for automobiles and home appliances. To do so, it develops a heuristic model of a consumer's decision problem when purchasing an energy consuming durable good in which uncertainty about each good's energy efficiency can be resolved via costly effort. The model indicates under what conditions the consumer will be less likely to undertake this effort. The empirical portion of the paper argues that energy efficiency is often not pivotal to choice. This, along with a simulation of the automobile market, suggests that returns to paying attention to energy may be modest, and analysis of the information readily available to consumers suggests that the costs of being fully informed may be substantial. The paper discusses the implications of rational inattention for public policy and for empirical research on the energy paradox.},

Second, when we rely on certifiers to act as the intermediary of quality disclosure, do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information?

The empirical review covers quality measurement, the effect of third-party disclosure on consumer choice and seller behavior, as well as the economics of certifiers.},

We find that the relationship between reported quality and nursing home choice is positive and statistically significant suggesting that patients were more likely to choose facilities with higher reported post-acute care quality after public reporting was initiated. However, the magnitude of the effect was small. We conclude that there has been minimal consumer response to information in the post-acute care market. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

We argue that if the share of import expenditure on the sampled products is falling over time, this will lead to an upward bias in the measured index.  Using a correction based on the falling expenditure share on sampled countries, we find that the income elasticity of aggregate U.S. import demand is reduced from 2.5 to 1.7, or about halfway to unity.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption, Congress recently amended the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulation to encourage improvements in the fuel efficiency of new vehicles. Automotive firms have multiple strategies available to them to respond to this policy intervention, and the responses they choose have potentially significant welfare implications. This paper presents one of the first analyses of the reformed CAFE, explicitly accounting for medium-term compliance strategies that include both technology implementation and tradeoffs between vehicle attributes. We use physics-based simulations to identify engineering tradeoffs between fuel economy and other vehicle attributes independent of unobservable vehicle attributes. Final estimation of the demand side is still pending, but we present preliminary results using a demonstrational demand-side estimation. Preliminary results indicate that while firms rely on technology implementation to a significant extent to comply with the reformed CAFE, only 50{\%} of the potential reductions in fuel consumption from these technologies are realized, with the remainder applied to improving acceleration performance. Results also suggest that ignoring tradeoffs between vehicle attributes significantly overestimates the social surplus cost of the regulation. The methods presented are generalizable to many other consumer product industries with energy-efficiency regulations or incentives.},

Most of the real change that occurred between 1906 and 1982 occurred between 1906 and 1940. During these years, hedonic prices fell at an average annual rate of 5{\%}. The pace was brisker still during the first 8-12 years. Our measured declines can be decomposed into price and quality components. Our calculations suggest that 60{\%} of the overall decline 1906-1940 was due to process innovation and only 40{\%} to product innovation or quality change per se. Regressors representing mechanical systems matter in these calculations.},

abstract = {The U.S. federal government enacted fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks for the first time in September 2011. The effectiveness of increasing fuel efficiency standards is an open question among economists; one rationale for using this policy tool is if there are informational frictions that result in vehicle purchasers undervaluing the savings from increased fuel efficiency (Parry, Walls, and Harrington 2007). We measure by how much heavy truck owners undervalue lifetime fuel savings by employing recent advances to the classic hedonic approach to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for fuel efficiency. We find significant heterogeneity in heavy truck owners' willingness to pay for fuel efficiency, with the elasticity of fuel efficiency to price ranging from 0.40 at the 10th percentile to 1.39 at the 90th percentile, and an average of 0.91. Combining these results with estimates of lifetime fuel savings from increases in fuel efficiency, we find that heavy truck owners' willingness-to-pay for a 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency is, on average, just 21.7 percent of the expected lifetime fuel savings. These results suggest that introducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks might be an effective policy tool.},

abstract = {1.1 The Achilles Heel of Real Output and Wage Measures Studies of the growth of real output or real wages reveal almost two centu- ries of rapid growth for the United States and western Europe. As figure 1.1 shows, real incomes (measured as either real wages or per capita gross national product [GNP] ) have grown by a factor of between thirteen and eighteen since the first half of the nineteenth century. An examination of real wages shows that they grew by about 1 percent annually between 1800 and 1900 and at an accelerated rate between 1900 and 1950. Quantitative estimates of the growth of real wages or real output have an oft forgotten Achilles heel. While it is relatively easy to calculate nominal wages and outputs, conversion of these into real output or real wages requires calcula- tion of price indexes for the various components of output. The estimates of real income are only as good as the price indexes are accurate. During periods of major technological change, the construction of accurate price indexes that capture the impact of new technologies on living standards is beyond the practical capability of official statistical agencies. The essential difficulty arises for the obvious but usually overlooked reason that most of the goods we consume today were not produced a century ago. We travel in vehi- cles that were not yet invented that are powered by fuels not yet produced, communicate through devices not yet manufactured, enjoy cool air on the hot-test days1are entertained by electronic wizardry that was not dreamed of, and receive medical treatments that were unheard of. If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of real incomes over the last century, we must some- how construct price indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile machine, of carbon paper with photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching television, and of brain surgery with magnetic resonance imaging. Making a complete reckoning of the impact of new and improved consumer goods on our living standards is an epic task. The present study takes a small step in that direction by exploring the potential bias in estimating prices and output in a single area-lighting. This sector is one in which the measurement of “true” output is straightforward but where misleading approaches have been followed in the construction of actual price or output indexes. The bottom line is simple: traditional price indexes of lighting vastly overstate the increase in lighting prices over the last two centuries, and the true rise in living standards in this sector has consequently been vastly understated. The plan of this paper is as follows: I begin with an analysis of the history of lighting, focusing particularly on the revolutionary developments in this field. I then use data on lighting efficiency to construct a “true” price of light and compare this with “traditional” price indexes that are constructed using tradi- tional techniques. In the final section I engage in a Gedankenexperiment on the extent to which revolutionary changes in technology may lead to similarbiases for other consumer goods and services and the consequent underestima- tion of the growth of real incomes over the last century.},

abstract = {In choosing the level of quality to purchase, the buyer of a differentiated product also chooses a point on the marginal price schedule for that product. Hence, in general, the demand functions for product characteristics cannot be consistently estimated by ordinary least squares. Market equilibrium results in a matching of characteristics of demanders and suppliers. This matching restricts the use of buyer and seller characteristics as instruments when estimating demand and supply functions for product characteristics. The paper develops these issues. A stochastic structure for hedonic equilibrium models is then proposed, identification results are presented, and estimation procedures are outlined.

abstract = {Innovation was rampant in the computer industry during the late 1960s and the 1970s.  Did innovation vastly extend the capabilities of computers or simply reduce the costs of doing the same thing?  This question goes to the heart of whether the rate of decline in 'constant-quality' computing prices incorrectly identifies the sources of improvement and benefits from technological change.  This paper argues that innovation freed computers of technical constraints to providing new services, manifesting many new capabilities in systems with larger capacity.  Both anecdotal and quantitative evidence suggest that many buyers adopted new systems to get access to these new capabilities, not solely to take advantage of lower prices. The analysis divides itself into several related questions. First, what innovations in this period are associated with extensions of capabilities? Second, do buyers adopt products that embody extensions of capabilities?  Third, how does a measurement framework represent that action?  Are extensions embodied only in increases in capacity or are they embodied in other measurable features of a computer system as well?},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

In my econometric framework, consumers choose the type of engine based on their annual mileage; prices are set by the manufacturers. The relative pricing of gasoline and diesel cars appears to be consistent with monopolistic price discrimination, effectively segmenting low-mileage from highmileage consumers. On average, about 75{\%} to 90{\%} of the price differentials between gasoline and diesel cars can be explained by markup differences.

We take an alternative semiparametric approach to Rosen's second stage in which we assume that the parametric form of utility is known, but we place no restrictions on the aggregate distribution of utility parameters. If there are only a small number of products, we show how to construct bounds on individuals' utility parameters, as well as other economic objects such as aggregate demand and consumer surplus.

We then compare the implied changes in willingness-to-pay to the associated changes in expected future gasoline costs for cars of different fuel economies in order to calculate implicit discount rates. Using different assumptions about annual mileage, survival rates, and demand elasticities, we calculate a range of implicit discount rates similar to the range of interest rates paid by car buyers who borrow. We interpret this as showing little evidence of consumer myopia. (JEL D12, H25, L11, L62, L71, L81)},

abstract = {Economic models for hedonic markets characterize the pricing of bundles of attributes and the demand and supply of these attributes under different assumptions about market structure, preferences and technology. (See Jan Tinbergen, 1956, Sherwin Rosen, 1974 and Dennis Epple, 1987, for contributions to this literature). While the theory is well formulated, and delivers some elegant analytical results, the empirical content of the model is under debate. It is widely believed that hedonic models fit in a single market are fundamentally underidentified and that any empirical content obtained from them is a consequence of arbitrary functional form assumptions. The problem of identification in hedonic models is a prototype for the identification problem in a variety of economic models in which agents sort on unobservable (to the economist) characteristics: models of monopoly pricing (Michael Mussa and Sherwin Rosen, 1978; Robert Wilson, 1993) and models for taxes and labor supply (James Heckman, 1974). Sorting is an essential feature of econometric models of social interactions. (See William Brock and Steven Durlauf, 2001). In this paper we address the sorting problem in hedonic models. Nesheim (2001) extends this analysis to a model with peer effects. In this paper we note that commonly used linearization strategies made to simplify estimation and justify the application of instrumental variables methods, produce identification problems. The hedonic model is generically nonlinear. It is the linearization of a fundamentally nonlinear model that produces the form of the identification problem that dominates discussion in the applied literature. Linearity is an arbitrary and misleading functional form when applied to empirical hedonic models. Our research establishes that even though sorting equilibrium in a single market implies no exclusion restrictions, the hedonic model is generically nonparametrically identified. Instrumental variables and transformation model methods identify economically relevant parameters even 1 without exclusion restrictions. Multimarket data, widely viewed as the most powerful source of identification, achieves this result only under implausible assumptions about why hedonic functions vary across markets.},

abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various micro-organisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: the steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density, for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations, but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: new effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

abstract = {For a variety of reasons, it is likely that the market definition approach will remain an important tool in competition policy analysis for some time, despite the increased importance of other tools such as the simulation approach. Against the background of the new block exemption regulation for cars in Europe, we explore an econometric approach to define the relevant markets with differentiated products. On the one hand, the approach is directly consistent with the SSNIP-test, and it is in fact more satisfactory than previous approaches, such as critical elasticity analysis or the simple use of standard industry classifications. On the other hand, the approach shares a lot of features with the simulation approach (similar data requirements, and similar assumptions about current market power). We find that the relevant market for minivan cars is defined at the widest level, i.e., at the aggregate country level. Furthermore, in Italy, the relevant markets for domestic cars are defined at an intermediate level, i.e., at the segment level. In all other cases, the relevant markets for cars may be defined at the narrowest level, i.e., at the subsegment level. Based on these results, we identify the firms that may violate the market share thresholds stipulated in the block exemption regulation. We find that, if we would have used an approach based on standard industry classifications instead of our econometric approach, our conclusions would have been different and, in fact, inconclusive. We also draw attention to other issues in market definition that may be of use to practitioners.},

abstract = {The U.S. federal government enacted fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks for the first time in September 2011. The effectiveness of increasing fuel efficiency standards is an open question among economists; one rationale for using this policy tool is if there are informational frictions that result in vehicle purchasers undervaluing the savings from increased fuel efficiency (Parry, Walls, and Harrington 2007). We measure by how much heavy truck owners undervalue lifetime fuel savings by employing recent advances to the classic hedonic approach to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for fuel efficiency. We find significant heterogeneity in heavy truck owners' willingness to pay for fuel efficiency, with the elasticity of fuel efficiency to price ranging from 0.40 at the 10th percentile to 1.39 at the 90th percentile, and an average of 0.91. Combining these results with estimates of lifetime fuel savings from increases in fuel efficiency, we find that heavy truck owners' willingness-to-pay for a 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency is, on average, just 21.7 percent of the expected lifetime fuel savings. These results suggest that introducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks might be an effective policy tool.},

Since goods that disappear tend to have falling market values, matched model indexes select from the right tail price changes. The BLS can construct hedonic indexes that correct for this selection and are justified by standard arguments. In an empirical study of PC's hedonic produce sharp price declines while matched model indexes are near zero. Also, though there are modifications to hedonics that seem desirable, they are not those in current use.},

@article{Ekeland2002d,
abstract = {Economic models for hedonic markets characterize the pricing of bundles of attributes and the demand and supply of these attributes under different assumptions about market structure, preferences and technology. (See Jan Tinbergen, 1956, Sherwin Rosen, 1974 and Dennis Epple, 1987, for contributions to this literature). While the theory is well formulated, and delivers some elegant analytical results, the empirical content of the model is under debate. It is widely believed that hedonic models fit in a single market are fundamentally underidentified and that any empirical content obtained from them is a consequence of arbitrary functional form assumptions. The problem of identification in hedonic models is a prototype for the identification problem in a variety of economic models in which agents sort on unobservable (to the economist) characteristics: models of monopoly pricing (Michael Mussa and Sherwin Rosen, 1978; Robert Wilson, 1993) and models for taxes and labor supply (James Heckman, 1974). Sorting is an essential feature of econometric models of social interactions. (See William Brock and Steven Durlauf, 2001). In this paper we address the sorting problem in hedonic models. Nesheim (2001) extends this analysis to a model with peer effects. In this paper we note that commonly used linearization strategies made to simplify estimation and justify the application of instrumental variables methods, produce identification problems. The hedonic model is generically nonlinear. It is the linearization of a fundamentally nonlinear model that produces the form of the identification problem that dominates discussion in the applied literature. Linearity is an arbitrary and misleading functional form when applied to empirical hedonic models. Our research establishes that even though sorting equilibrium in a single market implies no exclusion restrictions, the hedonic model is generically nonparametrically identified. Instrumental variables and transformation model methods identify economically relevant parameters even 1 without exclusion restrictions. Multimarket data, widely viewed as the most powerful source of identification, achieves this result only under implausible assumptions about why hedonic functions vary across markets.},

We generalize Rosen's first stage to account for product characteristics that are not observed and to allow the hedonic pricing function to have a general nonseparable form. We take an alternative semiparametric approach to Rosen's second stage in which we assume that the parametric form of utility is known, but we place no restrictions on the aggregate distribution of utility parameters. If there are only a small number of products, we show how to construct bounds on individuals' utility parameters, as well as other economic objects such as aggregate demand and consumer surplus.

This paper makes use of an economic model of a congested road network in a stationary state to investigate two objections to road congestion pricing: it may be inequitable for the road users affected, and it generates perverse incentives for governments. The paper investigates how different congestion delay functions and different mixes of traffic affect these objections.

Strong addiction to a good requires a big effect of past consumption of the good on current consumption. Such powerful complementarities cause some steady states to be unstable. They are an important part of our analysis because even small deviations from the consumption at an unstable steady state can lead to large cumulative rises over time in addictive consumption or to rapid falls in consumption to abstention. Our theory also implies that "cold turkey" is used to end strong addictions, that addicts often go on binges, that addicts respond more to permanent than to temporary changes in prices of addictive goods, and that anxiety and tensions can precipitate an addiction.},

The optimization algorithms often converge at points where the first- and second-order optimality conditions fail. There are also cases of convergence at local optima. On convergence, the variation in the values of the parame- ter estimates translates into variation in the models' economic predictions.

abstract = {If time and effort are required to accurately ascertain the lifetime value of energy efficiency for a durable good, consumers might rationally ignore energy efficiency. This paper argues that such inattention may be rational in the market for automobiles and home appliances. To do so, it develops a heuristic model of a consumer's decision problem when purchasing an energy consuming durable good in which uncertainty about each good's energy efficiency can be resolved via costly effort. The model indicates under what conditions the consumer will be less likely to undertake this effort. The empirical portion of the paper argues that energy efficiency is often not pivotal to choice. This, along with a simulation of the automobile market, suggests that returns to paying attention to energy may be modest, and analysis of the information readily available to consumers suggests that the costs of being fully informed may be substantial. The paper discusses the implications of rational inattention for public policy and for empirical research on the energy paradox.},

All estimates indicate that prices, while higher than marginal costs, are not nearly as high as most theoretical models predict.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss some of the issues that arise with the computation of the implied value of travel-time savings in the case of discrete choice models allowing for random taste heterogeneity. We specifically look at the case of models producing a non-zero probability of positive travel-time coefficients, and discuss the consistency of such estimates with theories of rational economic behaviour. We then describe how the presence of unobserved travel-experience attributes or conjoint activities can bias the estimation of the travel-time coefficient, and can lead to false conclusions with regards to the existence of negative valuations of travel-time savings. We note that while it is important not to interpret such estimates as travel-time coefficients per se, it is nevertheless similarly important to allow such effects to manifest themselves; as such, the use of distributions with fixed bounds is inappropriate. On the other hand, the use of unbounded distributions can lead to further problems, as their shape (especially in the case of symmetrical distributions) can falsely imply the presence of positive estimates. We note that a preferable solution is to use bounded distributions where the bounds are estimated from the data during model calibration. This allows for the effects of data impurities or model misspecifications to manifest themselves, while reducing the risk of bias as a result of the shape of the distribution. To conclude, a brief application is conducted to support the theoretical claims made in the paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose a family of tests whose asymptotic power functions are tangent to the power envelope at one point and are never far below the envelope. When the series has no deterministic component, some previously proposed tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to members of this family. When the series has an unknown mean or linear trend, commonly used tests are found to be dominated by members of the family of point-optimal invariant tests. We propose a modified version of the Dickey-Fuller t test which has substantially improved power when an unknown mean or trend is present.

In this respect, we believe that the three-step procedure (design, application, and robustness checks) followed by the German court in the cement case is well suited to meet the appropriate legal standard and requirements, both with respect to accuracy and practicality.},

We argue that spending and financial preferences evolve as social norms interact with both cultural trends and institutional changes in household finance. We identify historical forces that raised consumption and debt over the past quarter century and interpret these events with Hyman Minsky's financial cycle framework. Strong consumption helped moderate recessions and boost growth since the mid 1980s. But unprecedented household debt has now culminated in a financial crisis that threatens to cause a deep recession.},

abstract = {The distribution of the value of travel time savings (VTTS) is investigated employing various nonparametric techniques to a large dataset originating from a stated choice experiment. The data contain choices between a fast and more expensive alternative and a slow and less expensive alternative. Increasing the implicit price of time leads to an increased share of respondents who decline to pay to save time. But a significant proportion of respondents, 13{\{}{\%}{\}}, remain willing to pay to save time at the highest price of time in the design. This means that the right tail of the VTTS distribution is not observed and hence the mean VTTS cannot be evaluated without additional assumptions. When socio-economic and situational variables are introduced into a semiparametric model it becomes possible to accept that the whole VTTS distribution is observed. Sixteen candidates for parametric VTTS distributions are investigated. Some distributions are simply not able to fit to the empirical distribution while others have very long tails. The mean VTTS is shown to be extremely dependent on the choice of parametric distribution. Requiring that the parametric distribution should be accepted against the nonparametric alternative narrows the field down to five candidates. One of the distributions tested here has also support within the observed range such that the estimated VTTS is bounded by the data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {T his paper considers the decision problem of a firm that is uncertain about the demand, and hence prof- itability, of a new product. We develop a model of a decision maker who sequentially learns about the true product profitability from observed product sales. Based on the current information, the decision maker decides whether to scrap the product. Central to this decision problem are sequential information gathering, and the option value of scrapping the product at any point in time. The model predicts the optimal demand for information (e.g., in the form of test marketing), and it predicts how the launch or exit policy depends on the firms demand uncertainty. Furthermore, it predicts what fraction of newly developed products should be launched on average, and what fraction of these products will fail, i.e., exit. The model is solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. We present an application of the model to the case of the U.S. ready-to-eat breakfast cereal industry. Simulations show that the value of reducing uncertainty can be large, and that under higher uncertainty firms should strongly increase the fraction of all new product opportunities launched, even if their point estimate of profits is negative. Alternative, simpler decision rules are shown to lead to large profit losses compared to our method. Finally, we find that the high observed exit rate in the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal industry is optimal and to be expected based on our model},

Building on models of entry in atomistically competitive markets, we show how the number of producers in an oligopolistic market varies with changes in demand and market competition. These analytical results structure our empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional industries. Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases. In markets with five or fewer incumbents, almost all variation in competitive conduct occurs with the entry of the second or third firm. Surprisingly, once the market has between three and five firms, the next entrant has little effect on competitive conduct.},

abstract = {In many decentralized markets buyers rely on intermediaries to find sellers. This paper argues that intermediaries can affect buyer welfare both directly by reducing expenses of buyers with high search cost but also indirectly through a search externality that affects the prices paid by those buyers that do not use intermediaries. To investigate these two effects this project uses data from the New York City trade-waste market in which all businesses in the city contract individually with private waste carters to arrange for their waste disposal. Search in this market is costly for buyers because of the large number of sellers and the idiosyncratic nature of the contractual arrangements. Buyers can either search and haggle by themselves or through a waste-broker. Combining elements from the empirical search and procurement-auction literature, I construct and estimate a model for such a decentralized market setting. Results from the model show that buyers both in the broker market and in the search market benefit significantly from the activity of intermediaries. Intermediaries also improve overall welfare by reducing the cost of price discovery and the mis-allocation of sales to higher cost sellers.},

abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a "credibility revolution" in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of "structural methods"; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates "treatment effects" based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where "progress is less dramatic." Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in fields such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.},

Next we compare the welfare effects of fuel economy standards and fuel taxes and discuss whether these two types of policies can be complementary. Finally, we review arguments for transitioning away from fuel economy regulations and toward a "feebate" system, a policy approach that imposes fees on vehicles that are fuel inefficient and provides rebates to those that are fuel efficient.},

abstract = {Urban transportation externalities are a key development challenge. Based on the existing literature, the authors illustrate the magnitudes of various external costs, review response policies, and measure and discuss their selection, particularly focusing on the context of developing countries. They find that regulatory policy instruments aimed at reducing local air pollution have been introduced in most countries in the world. On the other hand, fiscal policy instruments aimed at reducing congestion or greenhouse gas emissions are limited mainly to industrialized economies. Although traditional fiscal instruments, such as fuel taxes and subsidies, are normally introduced for other purposes, they can also help to reduce externalities. Land-use or urban planning, and infrastructure investment, could also contribute to reducing externalities; but they are expensive and play a small role in already developed megacities. The main factors that influence the choice of policy instruments include economic efficiency, equity, country or city specific priority, and institutional capacity for implementation. Multiple policy options need to be used simultaneously to reduce effectively the different externalities arising from urban road transportation because most policy options are not mutually exclusive.},

A key component in the model is the infinite number of users in the network, all of whom have common knowledge about the distribution of preferences in the population. In this setting, the congestion level is endogenously determined in the equilibrium of a game with a continuum of players. For the estimate, we use the first-order conditions of the users' utility maximization problem to derive the likelihood function. For inference, we apply a two-step, semi-parametric method. Using data from Santiago, Chile, we show that the estimated parameters confirm the effect of congestion on individuals' preferences and that demand elasticities obtained by using our framework are consistent with results reported in the literature. We use the model to evaluate the effect on the welfare of increasing the cost of car trips and implementing a second-best fare schedule for bus transit. We also assess the welfare loss caused by congestion in Santiago.},

@article{Levenstein2006b,
abstract = {Following George Stigler (1964), many economists assume that incentive problems undermine attempts by firms to collude to raise prices and restrict output. But the potential profits from collusion can create a powerful incentive as well. Theory cannot tell us, a priori, which effect will dominate: whether or when cartels succeed is thus an empirical question. We examine a wide variety of empirical studies of cartels to answer the following questions: (1) Can cartels succeed? (2) If so, for how long? (3) What impact do cartels have? (4) What causes cartels to break up? We conclude that many cartels do survive, and that the distribution of duration is bimodal. While the average duration of cartels across a range of studies is about five years, many cartels break up very quickly (i.e., in less than a year). But there are many others that last between five and ten years, and some that last decades. Limited evidence suggests that cartels are able to increase prices and profits, to varying degrees. Cartels can also affect other non-price variables, including advertising, innovation, investment, barri- ers to entry, and concentration. Cartels break up occasionally because of cheating or lack of effective monitoring, but the biggest challenges cartels face are entry and adjustment of the collusive agreement in response to changing economic conditions. Cartels that develop organizational structures that allow them the flexibility to respond to these changing conditions are more likely to survive. Price wars that erupt are often the result of bargaining issues that arise in such circumstances. Sophisticated cartel organizations are also able to develop multipronged strategies to monitor one another to deter cheating and a variety of interventions to increase barriers to entry. 1.},

Removing existing subsidies to transit and to parking, internalising transport externalities (mainly congestion) and optimising the frequency of transit service increases welfare by approximately 2{\%}. Optimal prices are higher than current prices in most transport markets, so that optimal transport demand is below current demand. There is a strong shift to public transport in the peak period. Finally, calculations for Brussels of optimal public transport prices for unchanged reference car taxes indicate that only limited welfare gains can be obtained by charging near-zero transit fares in peak hours. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A key restriction of the existing literature is the assumption that the discontinuity point is known, which does not always hold in practice.

First, we construct a unified test statistic to check whether there are selection or treatment effects. Our tests are shown to be consistent, and local powers are derived. Also, a bootstrap method is proposed to obtain critical values. Second, we estimate the treatment effect by first estimating the nuisance discontinuity point. It is shown that estimating the discontinuity point does not affect the efficiency of the treatment effect estimator.

abstract = {My first reaction to "The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics," authored by Joshua D. Angrist and J{\"{o}}rn-Steffen Pischke, was: Wow! This paper makes a stunningly good case for relying on purposefully randomized or accidentally randomized experiments to relieve the doubts that afflict inferences from nonexperimental data. On further reflection, I realized that I may have been overcome with irrational exuberance. Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my "con" article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized "natural" experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrophe is a powerful illustration of the fact that extrapolating from natural experiments will inevitably be hazardous. I discuss how the difficulties of applied econometric work cannot be evaded with econometric innovations, offering as examples some under-recognized difficulties with instrumental variables and robust standard errors. I conclude with comments about the shortcomings of an experimentalist paradigm as applied to macroeconomics, and some warnings about the willingness of applied economists to apply push-button methodologies without sufficient hard thought regarding their applicability and shortcomings.},

This paper considers whether and how travel time values should be used within evaluation. The basic theories of private and social travel time valuation are set out. Issues such as the valuation of working time savings, the case for segmenting values by journey purpose and length, sign and size of time savings and mode of travel, and the income elasticity of the value of time, are reviewed. Two of the main conclusions are that time is a scarce resource and should be valued but that direct use of willingness to pay values is inappropriate for social appraisal of projects.

A dynamic approach incorporating this linkage in food demand is developed, where consumers maximize utility over time by choosing fat intake to control their cumulative fat level. The resulting dynamic indirect utility function and household data on meat, fish, and dairy consumption are used to estimate a censored demand system. Results show that consumers consciously adjust, but not instantaneously, their cumulative fat level. Highly educated households have a faster rate of adjustment of cumulative fat. When cumulative fat level increases, consumers shift to dairy or white meat from red meat products.},

We employ a standard optimal-taxation framework, but replace the standard assumption that all consumers have 100{\%} self control with an assumption that some consumers may have some degree of self-control problems. We show that imposing taxes on unhealthy items and returning the proceeds to consumers can generally improve total social surplus. Because such taxes counteract over-consumption by consumers with self-control problems while at the same time they naturally redistribute income to consumers with no self-control problems (who consume less), such taxes can even create Pareto improvements. Finally, we demonstrate with some simple numerical examples that even if the population exhibits relatively few self-control problems, optimal taxes can still be large. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various micro-organisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: the steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density, for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations, but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: new effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

Shifts in product demand and factor supplies should have no effect on the residual. Tests of this invariance property show that it fails in a great many industries.

Illustrations are drawn from ancient and modern antitrust cases involving price-fixing allegations. The stated goal of antitrust laws of most nations is deterrence. Optimal deterrence requires that cartel penalties be based on multiples of economic injuries. Yet, antitrust authorities are typically reluctant to calculate fines on the basis of damages because of perceived analytical challenges or because the fact-finders lack needed economic education. However, reasonable estimates of damages can often be quickly prepared using simpler methods than econometric modeling. More often than not, alternative estimates of cartel overcharges tend to be mutually supportive. The reluctance of antitrust authorities to base fines on damages seems to indicate an abundance of caution.},

The present model significantly improves upon the reduced-form profit functions typically used in the entry and location choice literature, because the variable profits that enter the product-choice decision are derived from a structuralmodel of demand and price competition. Given the heterogeneity in consumers' product valuations and responses to price changes, this is a critical element in the analysis of product assortment decisions. Relative to the literature on structural demand models, our results show that incorporating endogenous product choice is essential for policy simulations and may entail very different conclusions from settings where product assortment choices are held fixed},

Many models have been proposed, but perhaps the most important in current use, apart from the original linear expenditure system, are the Rotterdam model and the translog model. Both of these models have been extensively estimated and have, in addition, been used to test the homogeneity and symmetry restrictions of demand theory. In this paper, we propose and estimate a new model which is of comparable generality to the Rotterdam and translog models but which has considerable advantages over both. The model, which we call the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), gives an arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system; it satisfies the axioms of choice exactly; it aggregates perfectly over consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves; it has a functional form which is consistent with known household-budget data; it is simple to estimate, largely avoiding the need for non-linear estimation; and it can be used to test the restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry through linear restrictions on fixed parameters.},

Pre-existing taxes imply significantly higher abatement costs for every instrument considered, but the cost-impact of such taxes differs sharply across instruments. Prior taxes can eliminate the cost-advantage of market-based instruments (emissions taxes and permits) over technology mandates or performance standards, particularly if the former policies fail to generate revenues and use the revenues to finance cuts in the prior distortionary taxes. The cost differences between instruments are highly sensitive to the extent of pollution abatement: for most policies, abatement costs converge to the same value as pollution abatement approaches 100 percent.},

abstract = {In differentiated product markets, the entry and exit of individual product models— rather than of firms—often serve as the main equilibrating force. Market structure changes that lead to high prices also tend to encourage entry, partially offsetting the effects. Thus, accurately predicting changes from a merger or bankruptcy should in- corporate this behavior. I develop a model of equilibrium product characteristics in oligopoly and show how inequalities can identify the sunk costs of offering them. I apply these methods to an original dataset of all US commercial vehicles from 1987 to 2012 and assess their importance in the context of the {\$}85 billion bailout of the automotive industry in 2009. In the case where GM and Chrysler are liquidated rather than res- cued, estimated sunk costs are low enough to induce product entry by rivals, and this has a dramatic effect on prices and purchases. Markup increases for the most affected products drop by two-thirds when I account for model-level entry and exit. The decrease in total output is also moderated by about one-half. Acquisitions are an alternative to liquidation. I show that although the policy choice, including who the acquiring firm is, matters a lot when model-level entry and exit are ignored, it matters little when they are accounted for.},

abstract = {Economists have long advocated congestion pricing as an efficient way of allocating scarce roadway capacity. However, with a few exceptions, congestion tolls are rarely used in practice and strongly opposed by the public and elected officials. Although high implementation costs and privacy issues are alleviated as appropriate technologies are developed, the concerns that congestion pricing will adversely affect low-income travelers remain. In this paper, we use a strategic transportation planning model calibrated for the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to compare the welfare and distributional effects of three pricing schemes: value pricing (HOT lanes), limited congestion pricing, and comprehensive congestion pricing. We find that social welfare gains from HOT lanes amount to three-quarters of those from the comprehensive road pricing. At the same time, a HOT lanes policy turns out to be much more equitable than other road pricing schemes, with all income groups strictly benefiting even before the toll revenue is recycled.},

abstract = {Gasoline taxes can be employed to correct externalities from automobile use and to raise government revenue. Our understanding of the optimal gasoline tax and the efficacy of existing taxes is largely based on empirical analysis of consumer responses to gasoline price changes. In this paper, we examine directly how gasoline taxes affect gasoline consumption as distinct from tax-inclusive retail gasoline prices. We find robust evidence that consumers respond more strongly to gasoline tax changes under a variety of model specifications. We discuss two potential reasons for our main findings as well as their implications. (JEL D12, H21, H25, H31, L71, Q35)},

Although there are numerous studies which use time-series data to estimate complete demand systems, and many which estimate Engel curves from household budget data, there are virtually none which combine budget data from different periods to estimate complete systems. Since each budget study corresponds to a single price situation, one might conjecture that estimation of complete systems would not be possible unless budget studies were available from a large number of periods. This is incorrect. In Section 1 of this paper, it is argued that interesting complete demand systems can be estimated from a small number of budget studies, despite the limited price variability represented in such data. To demonstrate this, budget study data is used for two periods to estimate a pair of related demand systems: the familiar linear expenditure system and a quadratic expenditure system.},

We focus on the impact of ratings disseminated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and use our estimates to calculate the value of the information. Our approach exploits a novel feature of the data - the availability of nonpublic plan ratings - to correct for a source of bias that is inherent in studies of consumer responsiveness to information on product quality: since publicized ratings are correlated with other quality signals known to consumers (but unobserved by researchers), the estimated influence of ratings is likely to be overstated. We control for this bias by comparing the estimated impact of publicized ratings to the estimated impact of ratings that were never disclosed. The results indicate that NCQA's plan ratings had a meaningful influence on individuals' choices, particularly for individuals choosing a plan for the first time. Although we estimate that a very small fraction of individual decisions were materially affected by the information, for those that were affected the implied utility gains are substantial. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bajari2001,
abstract = {We derive some theoretical economic properties of standard discrete choice econometric models that we believe are undesirable if the models are to be used as structural models of demand. We show that many standard models have the following properties: as the number of products increases, the compensating variation for removing all of the inside goods tends to infinity, all firms in a Bertrand-Nash pricing game have markups that are bounded away from zero, and for each good there is always some consumer that is willing to pay an arbitrarily large sum for the good. These undesirable properties may lead to incorrect conclusions about many policies of interest, including calculation of price indexes, the benefits of new goods, and the welfare loss due to mergers. We demonstrate that these undesirable properties hold not only in the logit model, but also in all random utility models with the following three general properties: 1) the model includes an additive error term whose conditional support is unbounded, 2) the deterministic part of the utility function satisfies standard continuity and monotonicity conditions, and 3) the hazard rate of the error distribution is bounded above. One approach to avoiding these undesirable properties is to weaken these three restrictions. However, we also show that random utility models are not in general non-parametrically identified from market shares or individual level choice data. Our findings support the use of alternative structural approaches that have better economic properties, such as those of Bajari and Benkard (2001) and Berry and Pakes (2000).},

The regulation increases the cost of replacing worn out parts, and limits the firm's scope of potential capital investments. Such restrictions may lead to greater retirements and lower utilization, adversely affecting profits. Prior to the 2000 presidential election, investors expected Bush to have a narrower interpretation of NSR than Gore. Therefore, we use changes in stock prices to estimate the effect on profits of differences in NSR policy. Our results indicate that investors expected the average boiler to be {\$}38millionmore valuable under the Bush administration. Over the boilers' lifetimes, the additional utilization will have increased emissions by 19million tons of sulfur dioxide, 5.9 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 980 million tons of carbon dioxide, relative to natural gas generation.},

Darryll Hendricks, Jayendu Patel, and Richard Zeckhauser's (1993) 'hot hands' result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Narasimham Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers. Copyright 1997 by American Finance Association.},

The econometric procedure centers on the estimation of a discrete choice model (the nested multinominal logit), which yields the parameters of a utility function defined over the changing quality dimensions of the innovative product. The estimated flow of social gains from innovation is used to compute a social rate of return to R {\&} D, to explore the interrelation between innovation and diffusion, and to trace the time profile of benefits and costs, the latter suggesting the possible occurrence of "technological cycles."},

abstract = {Procurement contracts are often incomplete because the initial plans and specifications are changed and refined after the contract is awarded to the lowest bidder. This results in a final cost to the buyer that differs from the low bid, and may also involve significant adaptation and renegotiation costs. We propose a stylized model of bidding for incomplete contracts and apply it to data from highway paving contracts. Reduced form regressions suggest that bidders respond strategically to contractual incompleteness and that adaptation costs, broadly defined, are an important determinant of the observed bids. We then estimate the costs of adaptation and bidder markups using a structural auction model. The estimates suggest that adaptation costs on average account for about ten percent of the winning bid. The distortions from private information and local market power, which are the focus on much of the literature on optimal procurement mechanisms, are much smaller by comparison.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

Damages, induced inefficiency and the return to the ring are estimated using a structural model in the spirit of Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2000). A notable finding is that non-ring bidders suffered damages that were likely of the same order of magnitude as those of the sellers.},

@article{Verhoef2002,
abstract = {The authors explore the properties of various types of public and private pricing on a congested road network, with heterogeneous users, and allowing for elastic demand. The network allows them to model certain features of real-world significance: pricing restrictions on either complementary or substitute links, as well as interactions between different user groups on shared links. They find that revenue-maximising pricing is much less efficient than welfare-maximising pricing, but this difference is mitigated by the product differentiation made possible with heterogeneous users. Ignoring heterogeneity causes the welfare benefits of a policy of current interest, namely second-best pricing of one of two parallel links, to be dramatically underestimated. Unlike first-best policies, second-best policies are in danger of losing much of their potential effectiveness if heterogeneity is ignored when setting toll levels.},

@article{Caves1980,
abstract = {An economist who wishes to apply the neoclassical theory of consumer behavior to a body of data must specify a functional representation of consumer preferences. The set of functional forms which are plausible candidates to represent consumer preferences has grown rapidly in the past decade. This growth is attributable to the application of duality theory to economic analysis and the concomitant development of flexible functional forms. In this context, flexibility is defined as the ability to represent consumer preferences without placing any prior restrictions on the full set of price and income elasticities at a base point. Statistical investigations have recognized that the ability of a function to perform well over a range of data points, in addition to the base point, is an important criterion to be used in choosing among flexible forms. This suggests that the global properties of flexible functional forms must be known before there can be adequate understanding of the differences among these forms. The existing evidence is based entirely upon the empirical results from specific data sets. Hence it is difficult to utilize these results to gain general insight into the properties of different flexible functional forms or to choose among forms for particular applications.},

Our results suggest that concerns about the potential adverse welfare effects of TRIPS may have some basis. We estimate that the withdrawal of all domestic products in this subsegment is associated with substantial welfare losses to the Indian economy, even in the presence of price regulation. The overwhelming portion of this welfare loss derives from the loss of consumer welfare.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic theory of body weight and develops its implications. We argue that technological change has induced weight growth by making home- and market-production more sedentary and by lowering food prices through agricultural innovation. In addition, we illustrate that, while exercise and food intake are complements, reductions in exercise will always raise optimal body weight, as will increases in food intake. We also characterize how body weight varies with income, both within a country, and across countries. Within a country, income may have an inverted U-shaped relationship with body weight, due to the offsetting effects of the demand for food, and the demand for an ideal body weight. This can have important implications for the body weight impacts of public transfer programs. Across countries, however, mean weight is likely to be higher in richer countries. Finally, we present descriptive empirical evidence that illustrates the inverted U-shaped relationship between body weight and income in US males, and suggests the importance of secular trends in weight gain, which are consistent with the impacts of broad-based technological changes.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the efficiency and distributional impacts of congestion pricing in Vickrey's (1969) dynamic bottleneck model of congestion, allowing for continuous distributions of values of time and schedule delay. We find that congestion pricing can leave a majority of travellers better off even without returning the toll revenues to them. We also find that the consumer surplus losses or gains from tolling are not strictly monotonic in the value of time, because they also depend on the value of schedule delays. The greatest losses are not incurred by drivers with the lowest value of time, but by users with an intermediate value of schedule delays and the lowest value of time for that value of schedule delays. For second-best pricing with an untolled alternative, the pattern of distributional effects is quite similar to that for first-best pricing. In contrast with results from prior static models, users who are indifferent between the two alternative routes are not the ones who gain least from this type of second-best pricing. Our results suggest that, in assessing the distributional impacts of road congestion pricing, it is important to take into account both the distribution of the value of time and of the value of schedule delays, as well as the dynamics of departure time choice. {\#}},

abstract = {Abstract: Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures, and that the productivity increases that followed deregulation were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.

abstract = {Most economies feature levels of public spending that require more tax revenues than would be generated solely from the pollution taxes set according to the Pigovian principle, that is, set equal to marginal environmental damages. As a consequence, tax systems generally rely on both environmental (corrective) and other taxes. However, economists typically have analyzed environmental taxes without taking into account the presence of other, distortionary taxes. The omission is significant because the consequences of environmental taxes depend fundamentally on the levels of other taxes, including income and commodity taxes. This paper examines how optimal environmental tax rates deviate from rates implied by the Pigovian principle in a second-best setting where other, distortionary taxes are present. Previous investigations of this issue include the partial equilibrium analyses of Dwight R. Lee and Walter S. Misiolek (1986) and Wallace E. Oates (1991), who derive formulas linking the optimal rate for a newly imposed environmental tax to the marginal excess burden from existing taxes. In a general-equilibrium setting, Agnar Sandmo (1975) and Bovenberg and Frederick van der Ploeg (1994) have demonstrated how the well-known "Ramsey" formula for optimal commodity taxes is altered when one of the consumption commodities generates an externality. The present paper contributes to the analytical and empirical literature in three ways. First, it extends earlier analytical work on op-timal environmental taxation in a general-equilibrium setting by considering pollution taxes imposed on intermediate inputs. This is a useful extension because many actual environmental regulations and taxes affect the costs of intermediate inputs. Second, the paper investigates second-best optimal environmental taxes numerically. Here we expand on the analytical work by employing a numerical general-equilibrium model of the United States. The use of a numerical model enables us to employ... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Two new classes of probability distributions are introduced that radically simplify the process of developing variance components structures for extreme-value and logistic distributions. When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recursively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent- and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computational...},

abstract = {1.1 The Achilles Heel of Real Output and Wage Measures Studies of the growth of real output or real wages reveal almost two centu- ries of rapid growth for the United States and western Europe. As figure 1.1 shows, real incomes (measured as either real wages or per capita gross national product [GNP] ) have grown by a factor of between thirteen and eighteen since the first half of the nineteenth century. An examination of real wages shows that they grew by about 1 percent annually between 1800 and 1900 and at an accelerated rate between 1900 and 1950. Quantitative estimates of the growth of real wages or real output have an oft forgotten Achilles heel. While it is relatively easy to calculate nominal wages and outputs, conversion of these into real output or real wages requires calcula- tion of price indexes for the various components of output. The estimates of real income are only as good as the price indexes are accurate. During periods of major technological change, the construction of accurate price indexes that capture the impact of new technologies on living standards is beyond the practical capability of official statistical agencies. The essential difficulty arises for the obvious but usually overlooked reason that most of the goods we consume today were not produced a century ago. We travel in vehi- cles that were not yet invented that are powered by fuels not yet produced, communicate through devices not yet manufactured, enjoy cool air on the hot-test days1are entertained by electronic wizardry that was not dreamed of, and receive medical treatments that were unheard of. If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of real incomes over the last century, we must some- how construct price indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile machine, of carbon paper with photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching television, and of brain surgery with magnetic resonance imaging. Making a complete reckoning of the impact of new and improved consumer goods on our living standards is an epic task. The present study takes a small step in that direction by exploring the potential bias in estimating prices and output in a single area-lighting. This sector is one in which the measurement of “true” output is straightforward but where misleading approaches have been followed in the construction of actual price or output indexes. The bottom line is simple: traditional price indexes of lighting vastly overstate the increase in lighting prices over the last two centuries, and the true rise in living standards in this sector has consequently been vastly understated. The plan of this paper is as follows: I begin with an analysis of the history of lighting, focusing particularly on the revolutionary developments in this field. I then use data on lighting efficiency to construct a “true” price of light and compare this with “traditional” price indexes that are constructed using tradi- tional techniques. In the final section I engage in a Gedankenexperiment on the extent to which revolutionary changes in technology may lead to similarbiases for other consumer goods and services and the consequent underestima- tion of the growth of real incomes over the last century.},

abstract = {Economic models for hedonic markets characterize the pricing of bundles of attributes and the demand and supply of these attributes under different assumptions about market structure, preferences and technology. (See Jan Tinbergen, 1956, Sherwin Rosen, 1974 and Dennis Epple, 1987, for contributions to this literature). While the theory is well formulated, and delivers some elegant analytical results, the empirical content of the model is under debate. It is widely believed that hedonic models fit in a single market are fundamentally underidentified and that any empirical content obtained from them is a consequence of arbitrary functional form assumptions. The problem of identification in hedonic models is a prototype for the identification problem in a variety of economic models in which agents sort on unobservable (to the economist) characteristics: models of monopoly pricing (Michael Mussa and Sherwin Rosen, 1978; Robert Wilson, 1993) and models for taxes and labor supply (James Heckman, 1974). Sorting is an essential feature of econometric models of social interactions. (See William Brock and Steven Durlauf, 2001). In this paper we address the sorting problem in hedonic models. Nesheim (2001) extends this analysis to a model with peer effects. In this paper we note that commonly used linearization strategies made to simplify estimation and justify the application of instrumental variables methods, produce identification problems. The hedonic model is generically nonlinear. It is the linearization of a fundamentally nonlinear model that produces the form of the identification problem that dominates discussion in the applied literature. Linearity is an arbitrary and misleading functional form when applied to empirical hedonic models. Our research establishes that even though sorting equilibrium in a single market implies no exclusion restrictions, the hedonic model is generically nonparametrically identified. Instrumental variables and transformation model methods identify economically relevant parameters even 1 without exclusion restrictions. Multimarket data, widely viewed as the most powerful source of identification, achieves this result only under implausible assumptions about why hedonic functions vary across markets.},

The prevailing economic paradigm for understanding these forms of behavior is that health behaviors are investments, where foregone current pleasure leads to improvement in future well being (Michael Grossman, 1972). As such, variation in health behaviors will be explained by differences in discount rates or the value of life. In this theory is right, health behaviors will differ across people, but for a given person, behaviors will be highly correlated: those who value their health highly and are sufficiently optimistic about the future will have much better behaviors than those who do not.},

Using recent algorithms to compute all of the Nash equilibria to a game, we propose simulation-based estimators for static, discrete games.We demonstrate that the model is identified under weak functional form assumptions using exclusion restrictions and an identification at infinity approach.Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that the esti- mator can perform well in moderately sized samples. As an application, we study entry decisions by construction contractors to bid on highway projects in California.We find that an equilibrium is more likely to be observed if it maximizes joint profits, has a higher Nash product, uses mixed strategies, and is not Pareto dominated by another equilibrium.},

abstract = {Empirical exercises in economics frequently involve estimation of highly nonlinear models. The criterion function may not be globally concave or convex and exhibit many local extrema. Choosing among these local extrema is non-trivial for a variety of reasons. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of parameter estimates, and most importantly of economic variables of interest, to both starting values and the type of non-linear optimization algorithm employed. We focus on a class of demand models for differentiated products that have been used extensively in industrial organization, and more recently in public and labor. We find that convergence may occur at a number of local extrema, at saddles and in regions of the objective function where the first-order conditions are not satisfied. We find own- and cross-price elasticities that differ by a factor of over 100 depending on the set of candidate parameter estimates. In an attempt to evaluate the welfare effects of a change in an industry's structure, we undertake a hypothetical merger exercise. Our calculations indicate consumer welfare effects can vary between positive values to negative seventy billion dollars depending on the set of parameter estimates used.},

Supporters argue that appliance standards help address a number of market failures. In particular, many studies have pointed out that landlords may buy cheap inefficient appliances when their tenants pay the utility bill. Although this landlord-tenant problem has been widely discussed in the literature, there is little empirical evidence on the magnitude of the distortion. This paper compares appliance ownership patterns between homeowners and renters using household-level data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. The results show that, controlling for household income and other household characteristics, renters are significantly less likely to have energy efficient refrigerators, clothes washers and dishwashers.},

abstract = {The article cites the gains from merger or collusion in product-differentiated industries with specific reference to three brewing firms in the U.S. A merger in an industry with differentiated products increases the market power of the merging firms to the extent that their products are close substitutes and that other firms produce only more distant substitutes. The residual demand elasticity for the merged firm is only half that of the pre-merged firms, a considerable increase in market power. Calculation of post-merger market power from the partial residual demand curve is straightforward. To summarize, the difference between the residual demand curve facing a single firm and the partial residual demand curve facing two firms is this: the price discipline that each of the two firms exerts on the other is isolated. The brewing industry is highly concentrated. Given the concentration and the product differentiation present in the industry, it is natural to ask whether there are gains to collusion or merger. Several long-term trends in the brewing industry's environment and structure affect the specification of residual demand curves for the 1962-83 sample period. The evidence for the absence of complete collusion is compelling; a change from the pricing rules firms now use to coordinated pricing would yield very large increases in profits.},

abstract = {In this article, we consider a class of discrete choice models in which consumers care about a finite set of product characteristics. These models have been used extensively in the theoretical literature on product differentiation and the goal of this article is to translate them into a form that is useful for empirical work. Most recent econometric applications of discrete choice models implicitly let the dimension of the characteristic space increase with the number of products (they have "tastes for products"). The two models have different theoretical properties, and these, in turn, can have quite pronounced implications for both substitution patterns and for the welfare impacts of changes in the number and characteristics of the goods marketed. After developing those properties, we provide alternative algorithms for estimating the parameters of the pure characteristic model and compare their properties to those of the algorithm for estimating the model with tastes for products. We conclude with a series of Monte Carlo results. These are designed to illustrate: (i) the computational properties of the alternative algorithms for computing the pure characteristic model, and (ii) the differences in the implications of the pure characteristic model from the models with tastes for products.},

Without public reporting, consumers may have little information to help them differentiate quality among providers, giving providers little incentive to compete on quality. Public reporting enables consumers to choose highly ranked providers. Using a four-year (2000-2003) panel dataset, we examine the relationship between report card scores and patient choice of nursing home after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began publicly reporting nursing home quality information on post-acute care in 2002. We find that the relationship between reported quality and nursing home choice is positive and statistically significant suggesting that patients were more likely to choose facilities with higher reported post-acute care quality after public reporting was initiated. However, the magnitude of the effect was small. We conclude that there has been minimal consumer response to information in the post-acute care market. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Direct effects of portfolio composition may also give younger managers an incentive to ‘‘herd'' into popular sectors.

Second, this article develops tests of this property based on the translog function as a quadratic approximation which are less restrictive than the Berndt-Christensen tests, since they do not impose a Cobb-Douglas structure on any portion of the underlying function. Finally, this article applies the approximate tests to the Berndt-Christensen data. Like Berndt-Christensen, we find little evidence to support labor separability. The solo exception is the possibility of forming an aggregate price index of capital and white collar workers. But this possibility is probably a property of the particular data used rather than of the underlying technology. Also like Berndt and Christensen, we find support for capital aggregation--both in terms of quantity and price indices--once labor aggregation is assumed a priori. However, our approximate testing procedure allows us to investigate the nature of the separability in more detail.},

abstract = {In attempting to simulate the operation of a dynamic route guidance system, the modelling task is concerned both with the operation of the control system and with the implications this has for modelling driver behaviour (whether or not the driver is receiving information from the controller) and network conditions. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the modelling issues which need to be considered when addressing such a problem, and which have been identified by various authors in reports on experimental/survey work and in discussion papers. In discussing the great number of challenges to the modelling world which have arisen from the interest in such systems, we seek to stimulate further discussion and to provide a framework within which any route guidance model may be critically evaluated. We consider such a framework to be particularly timely in the light of the wealth of simulation models currently being proposed - and widely varying conclusions being drawn - as a result of many major research initiatives currently underway throughout the developed world. It is our belief that the development of a model which adequately represents the performance of a dynamic route guidance system is of the utmost importance to the success of such an approach. It will not only provide a means for evaluating the potential benefits, but should also provide an essential insight into the most appropriate means for its implementation and improve our understanding of transportation networks.},

Specifically, we model the payoffs of games where a researcher observes qualitative or censored information about agents' decisions and payoffs. These models extend single-person qualitative choice models introduced by McFadden (1974) and others to multiple-person choice problems. The equations describing players' equilibrium strategies depend on the game's structure and the equilibrium solution concept. We show that one can describe the equilibria of a simultaneous-move Nash game with a linear system of dummy endogenous variables. We also show that sequential-move and cooperative models have different, but related, econometric structures. A series of applied examples address identification and estimation issues.

abstract = {In choosing the level of quality to purchase, the buyer of a differentiated product also chooses a point on the marginal price schedule for that product. Hence, in general, the demand functions for product characteristics cannot be consistently estimated by ordinary least squares. Market equilibrium results in a matching of characteristics of demanders and suppliers. This matching restricts the use of buyer and seller characteristics as instruments when estimating demand and supply functions for product characteristics. The paper develops these issues. A stochastic structure for hedonic equilibrium models is then proposed, identification results are presented, and estimation procedures are outlined.

The introduction of quality “report cards” for cardiac surgery in Pennsylvania provides an empirical setting to isolate the relative role of extrinsic and intrinsic incentives in determining surgeon response. Information on performance that was new to surgeons and unrelated to patient demand led to an intrinsic response four times larger than surgeon response to profit incentives. (JEL D83, I11, L15)},

Single-firm event studies play an important role in both scholarship and litigation despite the general invalidity of standard inference. We use a broad cross-section of 2000-2007 CRSP data and find that the standard approach performs poorly in terms of both Type I and Type II error rates. We discuss a simple-to-use alternative, the SQ test, based on sample quantiles of the empirical distribution of pre-event fitted excess returns, which has correct asymptotic Type I error rate. Results suggest that the test will be useful in studying the impact of firm-specific events such as regulation, anti-trust rulings, and corporate or securities litigation.},

Existing import price indexes are based on a sample of products from importing firms.  We argue that if the share of import expenditure on the sampled products is falling over time, this will lead to an upward bias in the measured index.  Using a correction based on the falling expenditure share on sampled countries, we find that the income elasticity of aggregate U.S. import demand is reduced from 2.5 to 1.7, or about halfway to unity.  Our estimates suggest that the aggregate import price index is upward biased by about one and one-half percentage points annually.},

One PD measures the substitutability between frontier and nonfrontier products, while a second PD measures the advantage afforded by a brand-name reputation. We find segmentation along both dimensions, which meant that the effects of competitive events (such as entry) were localized.

This difference emerged in the 1970s and it is biggest among the most educated. The puzzle becomes larger once we account for cigarette prices and anti-smoking regulations, which are both higher in Europe. There is a nonmonotonic relationship between smoking and income; among richer countries and people, higher incomes are associated with less smoking. This can account for about one-fifth of the U.S./Europe difference. Almost one-half of the smoking difference appears to be the result of differences in beliefs about the health effects of smoking; Europeans are generally less likely to think that cigarette smoking is harmful.},

It then goes on to describe a case study with the Dutch National Model System (LMS) for transport in which the logsum method and the commonly used value of time method are compared for a specific project (high speed trains that would connect the four main cities in the Randstad: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht).},

We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in international average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions.

For three regions (North America, Europe, and Japan), local models that use local explanatory returns provide passable descriptions of local average returns for portfolios formed on size and value versus growth.

A prototype demonstrates the system concept using a 1991 Boston travel survey and transportation system level of service data. The model system represents a person's choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary - most important - activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary - additional - tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Third, because Waxman-Markey was never implemented, I extend the RDD approach to incorporate prediction market prices which normalize estimates by policy realization probabilities. A final bounding analysis recovers a MAC range of {\$}5 to {\$}18 per ton CO2e.},

abstract = {In the wake of Dub�e, Fox and Su (2012), this paper (i) analyzes the consequences for the BLP Contraction Mapping (Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes, 1995) of setting the inner-loop convergence tolerance at the required level of in D 10 14 to avoid propagation of approximation error from inner to outer loop, and (ii) proposes acceleration as a viable alternative within the confines of the Nested-Fixed Point paradigm (Rust, 1987) to enhance the convergence properties of the inner-loop BLP Contraction Mapping. Drawing upon the equivalence between nonlinear rootfinding and fixed-point iter- ation, we introduce and compare two alternative methods specifically designed for handling large-scale nonlinear problems, in particular the derivative-free spectral al- gorithm for nonlinear equations (La Cruz et al., 2006, DF-SANE), and the squared polynomial extrapolation method for fixed-point acceleration (Varadhan and Roland, 2008, SQUAREM). Running a Monte Carlo study with specific scenarios and with Newton-Raphson as a benchmark, we study the characteristics of these algorithms in terms of (i) speed, (ii) robustness, and (iii) quality of approximation. Under the worst of circumstances we find that (i) SQUAREM is faster (up to more than five times as fast) and more robust (up to 14 percentage points better suc- cess rate) than BLP while attaining a comparable quality of approximation, and (ii) also outperforms DF-SANE in nearly all scenarios. Eliminating averaging bias against more robust algorithms, a performance profile subsequently shows that (iii) SQUAREM is both faster, delivers the best quality approximation, and is more robust than BLP, DF-SANE and Newton-Raphson.},

Implicit Marshallian demand systems allow the incorporation of both unobserved preference heterogeneity and complex Engel curves into consumer demand analysis, circumventing the standard problems associated with combining rationality with either unobserved heterogeneity or high rank in demand (or both). They also developed the exact affine Stone index (EASI) implicit Marshallian demand system wherein much of the demand system is linearised and thus relatively easy to implement and estimate. This chapter offers a less technical introduction to implicit Marshallian demands in general and to the EASI demand system in particular. I show how to implement the EASI demand system, paying special attention to tricks that allow the investigator to further simplify the problem without sacrificing too much in terms of model flexibility.

abstract = {The U.S. federal government enacted fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks for the first time in September 2011. The effectiveness of increasing fuel efficiency standards is an open question among economists; one rationale for using this policy tool is if there are informational frictions that result in vehicle purchasers undervaluing the savings from increased fuel efficiency (Parry, Walls, and Harrington 2007). We measure by how much heavy truck owners undervalue lifetime fuel savings by employing recent advances to the classic hedonic approach to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for fuel efficiency. We find significant heterogeneity in heavy truck owners' willingness to pay for fuel efficiency, with the elasticity of fuel efficiency to price ranging from 0.40 at the 10th percentile to 1.39 at the 90th percentile, and an average of 0.91. Combining these results with estimates of lifetime fuel savings from increases in fuel efficiency, we find that heavy truck owners' willingness-to-pay for a 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency is, on average, just 21.7 percent of the expected lifetime fuel savings. These results suggest that introducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks might be an effective policy tool.},

abstract = {Despite several decades of government policies to promote energy efficiency, estimates of the costs and benefits of such policies remain controversial. At the heart of the controversy is whether there is an “energy efficiency gap,” whereby consumers and firms fail to make seemingly positive net present value energy saving investments. High implicit discount rates, undervaluation of future fuel savings, and negative cost energy efficiency measures have all been discussed as evidence of the existence of a gap. We review explanations for an energy efficiency gap including reasons why the size of the gap may be overstated, neoclassical explanations for a gap, and recent evidence from behavioral economics that has potential to help us understand why a gap could exist. Our review raises fundamental questions about traditional welfare analysis, but we find the alternatives offered in the literature to be far from ready for use in policy analysis. Nevertheless, we offer several suggestions for policymakers and for future economic research. (JEL: Q38, Q41)},

abstract = {The mixed logit model is considered to be the most promising state of the art discrete choice model currently available. Increasingly researchers and practitioners are estimating mixed logit models of various degrees of sophistication with mixtures of revealed preference and stated preference data. It is timely to review progress in model estimation since the learning curve is steep and the unwary are likely to fall into a chasm if not careful. These chasms are very deep indeed given the complexity of the mixed logit model. Although the theory is relatively clear, estimation and data issues are far from clear. Indeed there is a great deal of potential mis-inference consequent on trying to extract increased behavioural realism from data that are often not able to comply with the demands of mixed logit models. Possibly for the first time we now have an estimation method that requires extremely high quality data if the analyst wishes to take advantage of the extended behavioural capabilities of such models. This paper focuses on the new opportunities offered by mixed logit models and some issues to be aware of to avoid misuse of such advanced discrete choice methods by the practitioner1.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic theory of body weight and develops its implications. We argue that technological change has induced weight growth by making home- and market-production more sedentary and by lowering food prices through agricultural innovation. In addition, we illustrate that, while exercise and food intake are complements, reductions in exercise will always raise optimal body weight, as will increases in food intake. We also characterize how body weight varies with income, both within a country, and across countries. Within a country, income may have an inverted U-shaped relationship with body weight, due to the offsetting effects of the demand for food, and the demand for an ideal body weight. This can have important implications for the body weight impacts of public transfer programs. Across countries, however, mean weight is likely to be higher in richer countries. Finally, we present descriptive empirical evidence that illustrates the inverted U-shaped relationship between body weight and income in US males, and suggests the importance of secular trends in weight gain, which are consistent with the impacts of broad-based technological changes.},

abstract = {We present new identification results for nonparametric models of differentiated products markets, using only market level observables. We specify a nonparametric random utility discrete choice model of demand allowing rich preference heterogeneity, product/market unobservables, and endogenous prices. Our supply model posits nonparametric cost functions, allows latent costs shocks, and nests a range of standard oligopoly models. We consider identification of demand, identi-$\backslash$n cation of changes in aggregate consumer welfare, identi cation of marginal costs,$\backslash$nidenti cation of firms marginal cost functions, and discrimination between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary approaches. The$\backslash$nfi rst demonstrates identi cation under the same nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for identifi cation of regression models. The second treats$\backslash$ndemand and supply in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading$\backslash$nto constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and cost$\backslash$nshifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first general formalization of Bresnahans (1981, 1982) intuition for empirically distinguishing between$\backslash$nalternative models of oligopoly competition. From a practical perspective, our results clarify the types of instrumental variables needed with market level data,$\backslash$nincluding tradeoffs between functional form and exclusion restrictions.},

abstract = {This paper proposes new tests for detecting the presence of a unit root in quite general time series models. Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey {\&} Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the demonstration that some rather well-known network-based formulations in operations research, that have heretofore largely gone unnoticed in activity-based travel research, offer a potentially powerful technique for advancing the general development of the activity-based modeling approach. These formulations can provide an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. A mathematical programming formulation is developed and used to identify the similarities and differences between traditional trip-based modeling methodologies and those pertaining to an activity-based approach. It is demonstrated that the two approaches are directly related. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@book{Greenstein1997c,
abstract = {Innovation was rampant in the computer industry during the late 1960s and the 1970s.  Did innovation vastly extend the capabilities of computers or simply reduce the costs of doing the same thing?  This question goes to the heart of whether the rate of decline in 'constant-quality' computing prices incorrectly identifies the sources of improvement and benefits from technological change.  This paper argues that innovation freed computers of technical constraints to providing new services, manifesting many new capabilities in systems with larger capacity.  Both anecdotal and quantitative evidence suggest that many buyers adopted new systems to get access to these new capabilities, not solely to take advantage of lower prices. The analysis divides itself into several related questions. First, what innovations in this period are associated with extensions of capabilities? Second, do buyers adopt products that embody extensions of capabilities?  Third, how does a measurement framework represent that action?  Are extensions embodied only in increases in capacity or are they embodied in other measurable features of a computer system as well?},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss Hicksian demand and compensating variation in the context of discrete choice. We first derive Hicksian choice probabilities and the distribution of the (random) expenditure function in the general case when the utilities are nonlinear in income. We subsequently derive exact and simple formulae for the expenditure and choice probabilities under price (policy) changes conditional on the initial utility level. This is of particular interest for welfare measurement because it enables the researcher to compute the distribution of compensating variation in a simple way. We also derive formulae for the joint distribution of expenditure, the choice before and after a policy change has been introduced. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Markets respond not just to current emission policies but also to expectations of future policies. We theoretically demonstrate a “green paradox” in a multiple-commodity market and empirically identify it in the U.S. energy market. We show that a future carbon pricing policy has an anticipation eﬀect which should decrease the near-term price of coal. If the future policy also decreases the near-term price of natural gas, then the policy increases emissions prior to its implementation while nonetheless decreasing cumulative emissions. An event study conﬁrms the theoretical prediction: the price of coal increased by {\$}1.30 per short ton upon the unexpected collapse of the U.S. Senate's 2010 climate eﬀort. The response of natural gas futures suggests that the legislative process was increasing U.S. emissions prior to 2013, but if the bill had passed, it would have eventually decreased cumulative emissions.},

abstract = {This essay reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on quality disclosure and certification. After comparing quality disclosure with other quality assurance mechanisms and describing a brief history of quality disclosure, we address two sets of theoretical issues. First, why don't sellers voluntarily disclose through a process of {\&}{\#}8220;unraveling{\&}{\#}8221; and, given the lack of unraveling, is it desirable to mandate seller disclosure? Second, when we rely on certifiers to act as the intermediary of quality disclosure, do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information? We further review empirical evidence on these issues, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and finance. The empirical review covers quality measurement, the effect of third-party disclosure on consumer choice and seller behavior, as well as the economics of certifiers.},

A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found ro generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

abstract = {Concerns about energy security and climate change have sparked legislators' interest in reducing gasoline consumption by increasing corporate average fuel-economy (CAFE) standards. Using an empirically rich simulation model and cost estimates for anticipated fuel-economy technologies, we estimate annual costs of reducing long-run gasoline consumption by 10{\%} via a 3.8 miles per gallon increase in the standards, and the potential cost savings from allowing manufacturers to buy and sell fuel-economy credits. Maximum gasoline savings would be realized only after all existing vehicles were replaced, or 14 years in our model. A gasoline tax would produce greater immediate savings by encouraging people to drive less, and eventually to choose more-fuel-efficient vehicles. We demonstrate the advantage of a tax by comparing the cost of the higher CAFE standards over the first 14 years against the cost of a gasoline tax that would save the same amount of gasoline over that time. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Protein structures can be encoded into binary sequences (Gabarro-Arpa et al., Comput Chem 2000;24:693-698) these are used to define a Hamming distance in conformational space: the distance between two different molecular conformations is the number of different bits in their sequences. Each bit in the sequence arises from a partition of conformational space in two halves. Thus, the information encoded in the binary sequences is also used to characterize the regionfile:///media/DPI/dataDirk/hamming.pdf s of conformational space visited by the system. We apply this distance and their associated geometric structures to the clustering and analysis of conformations sampled during a 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core. The cluster analysis of the simulation shows a division of the trajectory into two segments of 2.6 and 1.4 ns length, which are qualitatively different: the data points to the fact that equilibration is only reached at the end of the first segment. The Hamming distance is compared also to the r.m.s. deviation measure. The analysis of the cases studied so far shows that under the same conditions the two measures behave quite differently, and that the Hamming distance appears to be more robust than the r.m.s. deviation.},

@article{Fullerton1997,
abstract = {With no revenue requirement or where the government can use lump-sum taxes. Economist Arthur C. Pigou shows that the first-best tax on pollution is equal to the marginal environment at damage. Consumers then pay the social marginal cost of each item, the direct cost of resources, plus the indirect cost of pollution. Suppose government needs more revenue, however, and cannot use lump-sum taxes. In this second-best world, the intuition might tell people to raise all tax rates: the tax on any clean commodity should be raised above its first best level of zero, and the tax on a dirty good should be raised above its first-best Pigovian level. Despite this intuition, a recent paper by economists A. Lans Bovenherg and Ruud A. de Mooij claims to demonstrate that, in the presence of preexisting distortionary taxes, the optimal pollution tax typically lies below the Pigovian tax. This note argues that nothing is necessarily wrong with the intuition that all taxes should be raised. Nothing is wrong with the Bovenberg and de Mooij model either, but the above quote could be misinterpreted.},

abstract = {Between 1979 and 1987 there were three significant changes in the wage structure in the United States. the pecuniary returns to schooling increased by about a third; the wages of older relative to younger workers with relatively low education increased to some extent; and the wages of women relative to men rose by almost ten percent. It is important for policy purposes to know why these changes occurred and whether they are temporary or permanent. The paper investigates several alternative explanations of these wage structure phenomena, including the most popular ones that their principal causes were shifts in the structure of product demand, skilled-labor saving technological change, and changes in the incidence and level of rents received by lower skilled workers. our reading of the evidence suggests that the major cause of the dramatic movements in the wage structure during the 1980's may have been some combination of changes in both production technology and the average relative nonobserved quality of different labor groups.},

abstract = {US fuel economy standards have not been changed significantly in 20 years. Feebates are a market-based alternative in which vehicles with fuel consumption rates above a "pivot point" are charged fees while vehicles below receive rebates. By choice of pivot points, feebate systems can be made revenue neutral. Feebates have been analyzed before. This study re-examines feebates using recent data, assesses how the undervaluing of fuel economy by consumers might affect their efficacy, tests sensitivity to the cost of fuel economy technology and price elasticities of vehicle demand, and adds assessments of gas-guzzler taxes or rebates alone. A feebate rate of {\$}500 per 0.01 gallon per mile (GPM) produces a 16 percent increase in fuel economy, while a {\$}1000 per 0.01 GPM results in a 29 percent increase, even if consumers count only the first 3 years of fuel savings. Unit sales decline by about 0.5 percent but sales revenues increase because the added value of fuel economy technologies outweighs the decrease in sales. In all cases, the vast majority of fuel economy increase is due to adoption of fuel economy technologies rather than shifts in sales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is little evidence on the impacts of ambitious energy conservation programs, which aim at large reductions in energy use. Ambitious programs are more likely to trigger lumpy ad- justments inherent in the use of energy (e.g., appliance stock or habits). In this paper, I estimate the impacts on residential consumption of the most ambitious electricity conservation program to date. This was an innovative program of economic (e.g., ﬁnes) and social (e.g., conservation appeals) incentives implemented by the Brazilian government in 2001 in areas facing supply shortages of over 20{\%}. I ﬁnd that the program reduced average electricity consumption per customer by 28{\%} during the nine months of its implementation, and by 13{\%} until ten years later. Using individual billing data for three million customers, I show that average effects came from widespread reductions among customers. I also provide evidence that long–term impacts came mostly from lumpy adjustments in consumption behaviors (new habits). Finally, I structurally estimate a simple model to quantify the role of social incentives and lumpy ad- justments. Social incentives played a major role and may be particularly powerful in times of crisis. Importantly, a permanent 80{\%} tariff increase would have been necessary to achieve similar impacts without lumpy adjustments. The possibility of triggering lumpy adjustments may thus substantially reduce the incentives necessary to achieve large changes in energy use.},

In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

Empirical applications of production theory have been the subject of many studies in applied economics. Many markets are characterized by monopolistic, or more generally, oligopolistic behavior, therefore, making the price-taking hypothesis inappropriate. Moreover, in many cases we do not know the degree of competitiveness in certain markets and would, therefore, be interested in estimating it, or testing alternative possible hypotheses about its nature. In this article, the authors have extended the use of econometric production theory techniques to a general class of oligopolistic markets. They consider a fairly general oligopolistic market and provide a framework which enables us to analyze this market empirically and test various hypotheses about non-competitive behavior. Furthermore, they provide a measure of the degree of oligopolistic power of a firm that measures the deviation from purely monopolistic and competitive behavioral modes.},

abstract = {Tradable permit regulations have recently been implemented for climate change policy in many countries. One of the first mandatory markets was the EU Emission Trading Scheme, whose first phase ran from 2005-07. Unlike taxes, permits expose firms to volatility in regulatory costs, but are typically accompanied by property rights in the form of grandfathered permits. In this paper, we examine the effect of this type of environmental regulation on profits. In particular, changes in permit prices affect: (1) the direct and indirect input costs, (2) output revenue, and (3) the carbon permit asset value. Depending on abatement costs, output price sensitivity, and permit allocation, these effects may vary considerably across industries and firms. We run an event study of the carbon price crash on April 25, 2006 by examining the daily stock returns for 90 stocks from carbon intensive industries and approximately 600 stocks in the broad EUROSTOXX index. In general, firms in industries that tended to be either carbon intensive, or electricity intensive, but not involved in international trade, were hurt by the decline in permit prices. In industries that were known to be net short of permits, the cleanest firms saw the largest declines in share value. In industries known to be long in permits, firms granted the largest allocations were most harmed.},

We construct our models from inequality conditions that describe entrants' equilibrium strategies in simultaneous-move and sequential-move games, and use them to study the effects of entry in isolated monopoly markets for new automobiles. From estimates of the market size necessary to support one and two dealers, we conclude that monopoly dealers do not block the entry of a second dealer.

Regressions for portfolios and individual stocks indicate that domestic factor models explain much more time-series variation in returns and generally have lower pricing errors than the world factor model. In addition, decomposing the world factors into domestic and foreign components demonstrates that the addition of foreign factors to domestic models leads to less accurate in-sample and out-of-sample pricing. Practical applications of the three-factor model, such as cost of capital calculations and perfor- mance evaluations, are best performed on a country-specific basis.},

Enhancements include two entirely new chapters on modelling for private sector projects and on activity-based modelling; a new section on dynamic assignment and micro-simulation; and sizeable updates to sections on disaggregate modelling and stated preference design and analysis. It also tackles topical issues such as valuation of externalities and the role of GPS in travel time surveys. Providing unrivalled depth and breadth of coverage, each topic is approached as a modelling exercise with discussion of the roles of theory, data, model specification, estimation, validation and application. The authors present the state of the art and its practical application in a pedagogic manner, easily understandable to both students and practitioners. Follows on from the highly successful third edition universally acknowledged as the leading text on transport modelling techniques and applications Includes two new chapters on modelling for private sector projects and activity based modeling, and numerous updates to existing chapters Incorporates treatment of recent issues and concerns like risk analysis and the dynamic interaction between land use and transport Provides comprehensive and rigorous information and guidance, enabling readers to make practical use of every available technique Relates the topics to new external factors and technologies such as global warming, valuation of externalities and global positioning systems (GPS).},

We take an alternative semiparametric approach to Rosen's second stage in which we assume that the parametric form of utility is known, but we place no restrictions on the aggregate distribution of utility parameters. If there are only a small number of products, we show how to construct bounds on individuals' utility parameters, as well as other economic objects such as aggregate demand and consumer surplus.

We review literature on a broad range of existing non-transportation energy efficiency policies covering appliance standards, financial incentives, information and voluntary programs, and government energy use (building and professional codes are not included). Estimates indicate these programs are likely to have collectively saved up to 4 quads of energy annually, with appliance standards and utility demand-side management likely making up at least half these savings. Energy Star, Climate Challenge, and 1605b voluntary emissions reductions may also contribute significantly to aggregate energy savings, but how much of these savings would have occurred absent these programs is less clear. Although even more uncertain, reductions in CO2, NOX, SO2, and PM-10 associated with energy savings may contribute about 10{\%} more to the value of energy savings.},

abstract = {This paper presents an econometric technique for estimating the single firm residual demand curve that does not require the estimation of demand cross-elasticities. The technique is particularly suited for the estimation of firm market power in product differentiated industries, where cross-elasticities are notoriously difficult to measure. One estimated parameter is directly related to a firm's markup of price over marginal cost when product differentiation is extensive, when an industry consists of a dominant firm and a price-taking fringe, when a Consistent Conjectures Equilibrium is the correct oligopoly solution concept, when firms are Stackelberg leaders relative to their environment, or when firms are perfect competitors. The estimates can indicate power over price in other circumstances. An instrumental variables technique is employed, using firm-individuated factor prices to identify firm-specific residual demand. Yet even when instruments are unavailable, the technique produces elasticity estimates biased in the conservative direction of disproving market power. This methodology is applied to estimate the market power of three firms in an industry characterized by product differentiation: brewing. Over our 1962–82 sample period, Pabst and Coors had similar national market shares and each had high shares in several states. Yet Pabst was virtually a price-taker while Coors possessed substantial market power. Anheuser-Busch had market power in the early part of the sample, but little after 1975 when Miller Brewing changed the competitive nature of the industry.},

abstract = {Sugarcane in Brazil is processed into sugar and/or ethanol, often in flex plants that can switch between the two products. We develop an economic model of flex plants, export demands, and two domestic fuel demand curves for a blend of ethanol with gasoline consumed by conventional cars, and ethanol consumed only by flex cars. We analyze the market impacts of the following policies: the blend mandate; fixing gasoline prices below world prices; the high gasoline tax; and a higher tax exemption for ethanol blended with gasoline. Because Brazilian and U.S. ethanol prices have become linked, a change in Brazilian ethanol policy or a shock in world sugar markets can now impact U.S. ethanol and corn prices. We show that in theory, each policy analyzed has an ambiguous impact on ethanol and sugar prices. Empirically, however, a low gasoline tax and a high tax exemption for ethanol used in the fuel blend reduce ethanol and sugar prices; this contradicts conventional wisdom. Overall, we find that policy reforms implemented in 2010 offset the ethanol price increase by about 27{\%} due to outward shifts in fuel transportation and sugar export demand curves, and due to a reduced sugarcane supply caused by bad weather. Our model illustrates the importance of Brazil's ethanol policies on world commodity markets; it also provides insight into how the Brazilian government can adjust policies to better control domestic inflation while minimizing impacts on investment.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the technological progress that has occurred since 1980 in the automobile industry and the trade-offs faced when choosing between fuel economy, weight, and engine power characteristics. The results suggest that if weight, horsepower, and torque were held at their 1980 levels, fuel economy could have increased by nearly 60 percent from 1980 to 2006. Once technological progress is considered, meeting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards adopted in 2007 will require halting the trend in weight and engine power characteristics, but little more. In contrast, the standards recently announced by the new administration, while attainable, require nontrivial “downsizing.”},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the forces contributing to the worldwide long-run rise in obesity and the role of public interventions in affecting its continued growth. A growth in obesity in a population must result from the growth of calorie consumption outpacing the growth of physical activity. Yet historically in developed countries, obesity has grown with modest rises in calorie consumption and with a substantial increase in both exercise and dieting. We consider the economic incentives that give rise to the long-run growth in obesity by stimulating intake of calories at the same time as discouraging the expending of calories on physical activity, whether in work or leisure. We argue that technological change provides a natural interpretation of the long-run growth in obesity, that it predicts that the effect of income on obesity changes from positive to negative with economic development, and that it implies that technological change may not continue to raise weight. We discuss the positive and normative impacts of direct and indirect public interventions to reduce obesity.},

We first describe how these programs affect the automobile market, including impacts on fuel consumption and other dimensions of the vehicle fleet. We then review two different methodologies for assessing the costs of fuel economy programs-engineering and market-based approaches-and discuss what the results of these assessments imply for policy. Next we compare the welfare effects of fuel economy standards and fuel taxes and discuss whether these two types of policies can be complementary. Finally, we review arguments for transitioning away from fuel economy regulations and toward a "feebate" system, a policy approach that imposes fees on vehicles that are fuel inefficient and provides rebates to those that are fuel efficient.},

We investigate the heterogeneity in price-cost mark-up and workers' bargaining power parameters among 18 sectors within the manufacturing industry as well as the relationship between both parameters. Using a sample of more than 7000 firms, our GMM results indicate that ignoring imperfection in the labor market leads to an underestimation of the price-cost margin evaluated at perfect competition in the labor market. These findings are confirmed in the sectoral analysis. Sectors with higher workers' bargaining power typically show higher price-cost margins. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We develop a general framework for computing cartel damages claims. We decompose a direct purchaser plaintiff's lost profits in three parts: the price overcharge, the pass-on effect and the output effect. The output effect is usually neglected: it is the lost business resulting from passing on the price overcharge. To evaluate the relative importance of the three effects, we introduce various models of imperfect competition for the plaintiff's industry. We show that the passing-on defense generally remains justified after accounting for the output effect, provided that the cartel affects a sufficient number of firms. We derive exact discounts to the price overcharge, and illustrate how to compute these in the European vitamin cartel. We finally extend our framework to measure the cartel's total harm, i.e., the total damages to direct purchasers and their consumers.},

Direct measures of marginal cost and conduct, indicating small market power, serve as benchmarks. The more competitive models yield better cost estimates. The best cost estimates occur when conduct is estimated as a free parameter, which in turn only slightly underestimates our direct measure. It also tracks the decline in market power accompanying the industry's structural changes. The methodology is largely validated, although partial cost information can improve its predictive power. Conclusions are robust to the demand function.},

Feebates are a market-based alternative in which vehicles with fuel consumption rates above a "pivot point" are charged fees while vehicles below receive rebates. By choice of pivot points, feebate systems can be made revenue neutral. Feebates have been analyzed before. This study re-examines feebates using recent data, assesses how the undervaluing of fuel economy by consumers might affect their efficacy, tests sensitivity to the cost of fuel economy technology and price elasticities of vehicle demand, and adds assessments of gas-guzzler taxes or rebates alone. A feebate rate of {\$}500 per 0.01 gallon per mile (GPM) produces a 16 percent increase in fuel economy, while a {\$}1000 per 0.01 GPM results in a 29 percent increase, even if consumers count only the first 3 years of fuel savings. Unit sales decline by about 0.5 percent but sales revenues increase because the added value of fuel economy technologies outweighs the decrease in sales. In all cases, the vast majority of fuel economy increase is due to adoption of fuel economy technologies rather than shifts in sales. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We push the span of hedonic price calculations for automobiles backwards towards the industry's birth. Most of the real change that occurred between 1906 and 1982 occurred between 1906 and 1940. During these years, hedonic prices fell at an average annual rate of 5{\%}. The pace was brisker still during the first 8-12 years. Our measured declines can be decomposed into price and quality components. Our calculations suggest that 60{\%} of the overall decline 1906-1940 was due to process innovation and only 40{\%} to product innovation or quality change per se. Regressors representing mechanical systems matter in these calculations.},

@article{Cowling1976a,
abstract = {Industrial economists following from Mason and Bain have run innumerable tests (largely using US data) of the relation between various market structural variables and various dimensions of performance. The most popular activity has been to relate profit rates, variously defined, to measures of concentration and barriers to entry, but this activity has not always been clearly based on a well-defined theoretical model. When the theoretical model is spelled out it becomes obvious that some inter-industry relationships of this sort are meaningless because of certain omitted variables. A prime example is the omission of the industry price elasticity of demand, an omission that implies the strong assumption that demand elasticity is constant across industries within the cross-section. However, if we shift our focus to changes in structure effecting changes in performance, then it may be reasonable to assume that the omitted-variables problem is less severe; i.e., assuming the constancy of industry price elasticities over time may be less heroic than assuming that they are constant across industries. This paper will therefore proceed by setting up an explicit theoretical model of the relationship between structure and performance. The derived estimating equation relates change in price-cost margins to changes in concentration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The distribution of the value of travel time savings (VTTS) is investigated employing various nonparametric techniques to a large dataset originating from a stated choice experiment. The data contain choices between a fast and more expensive alternative and a slow and less expensive alternative. Increasing the implicit price of time leads to an increased share of respondents who decline to pay to save time. But a significant proportion of respondents, 13{\%}, remain willing to pay to save time at the highest price of time in the design. This means that the right tail of the VTTS distribution is not observed and hence the mean VTTS cannot be evaluated without additional assumptions. When socio-economic and situational variables are introduced into a semiparametric model it becomes possible to accept that the whole VTTS distribution is observed. Sixteen candidates for parametric VTTS distributions are investigated. Some distributions are simply not able to fit to the empirical distribution while others have very long tails. The mean VTTS is shown to be extremely dependent on the choice of parametric distribution. Requiring that the parametric distribution should be accepted against the nonparametric alternative narrows the field down to five candidates. One of the distributions tested here has also support within the observed range such that the estimated VTTS is bounded by the data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Issues such as the valuation of working time savings, the case for segmenting values by journey purpose and length, sign and size of time savings and mode of travel, and the income elasticity of the value of time, are reviewed. Two of the main conclusions are that time is a scarce resource and should be valued but that direct use of willingness to pay values is inappropriate for social appraisal of projects.

A prototype demonstrates the system concept using a 1991 Boston travel survey and transportation system level of service data. The model system represents a person's choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary - most important - activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary - additional - tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss some of the issues that arise with the computation of the implied value of travel-time savings in the case of discrete choice models allowing for random taste heterogeneity. We specifically look at the case of models producing a non-zero probability of positive travel-time coefficients, and discuss the consistency of such estimates with theories of rational economic behaviour. We then describe how the presence of unobserved travel-experience attributes or conjoint activities can bias the estimation of the travel-time coefficient, and can lead to false conclusions with regards to the existence of negative valuations of travel-time savings. We note that while it is important not to interpret such estimates as travel-time coefficients per se, it is nevertheless similarly important to allow such effects to manifest themselves; as such, the use of distributions with fixed bounds is inappropriate. On the other hand, the use of unbounded distributions can lead to further problems, as their shape (especially in the case of symmetrical distributions) can falsely imply the presence of positive estimates. We note that a preferable solution is to use bounded distributions where the bounds are estimated from the data during model calibration. This allows for the effects of data impurities or model misspecifications to manifest themselves, while reducing the risk of bias as a result of the shape of the distribution. To conclude, a brief application is conducted to support the theoretical claims made in the paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These formulations can provide an analytical framework that unifies the complex interactions among the resource allocation decisions made by households in conducting their daily affairs outside the home, while preserving the utility-maximizing principles presumed to guide such decisions. A mathematical programming formulation is developed and used to identify the similarities and differences between traditional trip-based modeling methodologies and those pertaining to an activity-based approach.

We estimate a model of patient flows for CABG patients that provides inputs for an entry model. We find that FFS provides a high return throughout the study period. Medicare, which had been generous in the early 1980s, now provides a return that is close to zero. Medicaid appears to reimburse less than average variable costs.

Building on models of entry in atomistically competitive markets, we show how the number of producers in an oligopolistic market varies with changes in demand and market competition. These analytical results structure our empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional industries. Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases. In markets with five or fewer incumbents, almost all variation in competitive conduct occurs with the entry of the second or third firm. Surprisingly, once the market has between three and five firms, the next entrant has little effect on competitive conduct.},

Specifically, we model the payoffs of games where a researcher observes qualitative or censored information about agents' decisions and payoffs. These models extend single-person qualitative choice models introduced by McFadden (1974) and others to multiple-person choice problems. The equations describing players' equilibrium strategies depend on the game's structure and the equilibrium solution concept. We show that one can describe the equilibria of a simultaneous-move Nash game with a linear system of dummy endogenous variables. We also show that sequential-move and cooperative models have different, but related, econometric structures. A series of applied examples address identification and estimation issues.

Following Bresnahan andReiss (1990, 1991), a discrete game is a generalization of a standard discrete choice model where utility depends on the actions of other players. Using recent algorithms to compute all of the Nash equilibria to a game, we propose simulation-based estimators for static, discrete games.We demonstrate that the model is identified under weak functional form assumptions using exclusion restrictions and an identification at infinity approach.Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that the esti- mator can perform well in moderately sized samples. As an application, we study entry decisions by construction contractors to bid on highway projects in California.We find that an equilibrium is more likely to be observed if it maximizes joint profits, has a higher Nash product, uses mixed strategies, and is not Pareto dominated by another equilibrium.},

The book is oriented to the practitioner. A basic understanding of the linear regression model with matrix algebra is assumed. The text can be used for a microeconometrics course, typically a second-year economics PhD course; for data-oriented applied microeconometrics field courses; and as a reference work for graduate students and applied researchers who wish to fill in gaps in their toolkit.

abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various micro-organisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: the steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density, for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations, but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: new effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

abstract = {Economic theory prescribes a (pigouvian) congestion tax in order to alleviate the negative effects of traffic congestion. It is simply a matter of internalizing a negative externality. However, traffic congestion is a pervasive problem in cities across the world, and a congestion tax is seldom applied. This paper tries to understand why this is the case. In order to do so, we estimate the welfare and traffic effects of alternative policies to be applied to the city of Sao Paulo; a congestion charge and a rotation system (or license plate restriction). With a dataset containing information on origin, destination and mode choice, we estimate a individual demand model for transportation mode. These demands are in turn used to run counter-factuals to evaluate the welfare costs of both policies. The results show that the congestion tax performs better than the rotation system in terms of aggregate welfare, but the distribution of these losses are very distinct. The congestion tax negatively affects alarger number ofpeople withlowerintensity thantherotation. Plus, therotationsystem concentrates the heavier losses in an even smaller group, and thas little or no effect on driving decisions of those who owns more than one car. These results support the argument that the rotation system is chosen since it affects less people and causes little or no welfare loss on the richer portion of the population.

The formulas account for congestion, pollution, accident externalities, scale economies, and agency adjustment of transit service offerings.

The results support the efficiency of the large current fare subsidies; even starting with fares at 50 percent of operating costs, incremental fare reductions are welfare improving in almost all cases.

abstract = {The mixed logit model is considered to be the most promising state of the art discrete choice model currently available. Increasingly researchers and practitioners are estimating mixed logit models of various degrees of sophistication with mixtures of revealed preference and stated preference data. It is timely to review progress in model estimation since the learning curve is steep and the unwary are likely to fall into a chasm if not careful. These chasms are very deep indeed given the complexity of the mixed logit model. Although the theory is relatively clear, estimation and data issues are far from clear. Indeed there is a great deal of potential mis-inference consequent on trying to extract increased behavioural realism from data that are often not able to comply with the demands of mixed logit models. Possibly for the first time we now have an estimation method that requires extremely high quality data if the analyst wishes to take advantage of the extended behavioural capabilities of such models. This paper focuses on the new opportunities offered by mixed logit models and some issues to be aware of to avoid misuse of such advanced discrete choice methods by the practitioner1.},
